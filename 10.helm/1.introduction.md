## What is Helm?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, a popular open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Think of Helm as a tool that simplifies the process of installing, configuring, and managing applications on a Kubernetes cluster. It does this by bundling all the necessary Kubernetes resources (like Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.) into a single package called a Helm chart. These charts act like reusable templates, making it easy to deploy complex applications with a single command.

Helm is often referred to as the "apt" or "yum" for Kubernetes, drawing parallels to package managers used in Linux distributions. It streamlines the management of Kubernetes applications by providing a standardized way to define, install, upgrade, and share applications.

Key Components of Helm
1. Helm Chart: A chart is a collection of files that describe a Kubernetes application. It includes:
Chart.yaml: Metadata about the chart (name, version, description).
values.yaml: Default configuration values that can be customized.
templates/: Directory containing Kubernetes manifest templates that use Go templating to inject values dynamically.
charts/: Directory for dependency charts.

2. Release: A release is an instance of a chart deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. Each release has a unique name and tracks its configuration and history, allowing upgrades or rollbacks.
Repository: A Helm repository is a web server (like GitHub Pages or ChartMuseum) that hosts packaged charts (.tgz files) and an index.yaml file, enabling users to share and access charts.

3. Helm CLI: The command-line tool (helm) used to interact with charts, repositories, and releases. It supports commands like helm install, helm upgrade, and helm repo add.
