## 1. Prerequisites: Kubernetes Installation
Before using Helm, a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster must be set up with at least one master node and one or more worker nodes.

- **Master Node Deployment Script:** https://tinyurl.com/k8s-master-node  
    - This script configures the Kubernetes control plane components on the master node.  
- **Worker Node Deployment Script:** https://tinyurl.com/k8s-worker-node  
    - This script sets up worker nodes to join the cluster and handle workloads.  
Note: Ensure kubectl is installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.

## 2. Helm Installation
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies application deployment.

- Installation Steps (Linux example):
```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```
- Verify installation:
```bash
helm version
```
